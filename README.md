# Data Science Portfolio

On this repository, I'll be adding some iPython Notebooks for projects in which I have worked during my Data Science self learning road.
I encourage you to test these notebooks by yourself on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to skip the boring dependency installation. I'll make my best effort to remember what parts of the code should be modified in order to use Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
If you chose to run these iPython Notebooks on your local machine, besides installing Python (hopefully version >= 3.5), you'll be needing the following packages. In my case, I prefer to install packages on an isolated Python environment using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

* Jupyter Notebooks (and dependencies). `pip install jupyter`. More info on [this](http://jupyter.org/install.html).
* Numpy. `pip install numpy`. More info [here](https://scipy.org/install.html).
* Pandas, `pip install pandas`. More info [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html).
* Matplotlib. `pip install matplotlib`. More info [here](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).
* Scikit-Learn. `pip install sklearn`. More info [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).

You can find the complete list of packages I use on my virtualenv for this repo on the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. If you want to replicate this on your machine just `pip install -r requirements.txt` it.

## What can you find in this repo?
So, this is the list of files that you'll find in this repository:
* [Basics on Numpy](EN/Basics%20on%20Numpy%20and%20Linear%20Algebra.ipynb): Useful functions on Numpy and some basics on linear algebra. You can see this notebook as a Cheat Sheet.
* [Basic End to End Machine Learning Project](EN/Basic%20End%20to%20End%20Machine%20Learning%20Project.ipynb):
A simple example of a complete machine learning project. Based on [Aurelien Geron's](ageron) "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow". Great book, by the way. You can find it [here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do).
