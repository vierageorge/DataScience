# Data Science Portfolio

On this repository, I'll be adding some iPython Notebooks for projects in which I have worked during my Data Science self learning road.
I encourage you to test these notebooks by yourself on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to skip the boring dependency installation. I'll make my best effort to remember what parts of the code should be modified in order to use Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
If you chose to run these iPython Notebooks on your local machine, besides installing Python (hopefully version >= 3.5), you'll be needing the following packages. In my case, I prefer to install packages on an isolated Python environment using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

* Jupyter Notebooks (and dependencies). `pip install jupyter`. More info on [this](http://jupyter.org/install.html).
* Numpy. `pip install numpy`. More info [here](https://scipy.org/install.html).

You can find the complete list of packages I have on the virtualenv that I use for this repo on the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. If you want to replicate this on your machine just `pip install -r requirements.txt` it.

## What can you find in this repo?
So, this is the list of files that you'll find in this repository:
* [Basics on Numpy](Basics on Numpy and Linear Algebra.ipynb): Usefull functions on Numpy and some basics on linear algebra. You can see this notebook as a Cheat Sheet.
