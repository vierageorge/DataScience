# Data Science Portfolio

On this repository, I'll be adding some iPython Notebooks for projects in which I have worked during my Data Science self learning road.
I encourage you to test these notebooks by yourself on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to skip the boring dependency installation.

## Prerequisites
If you chose to run these iPython Notebooks on your local machine, besides installing Python (hopefully version >= 3.5), you'll be needing the following packages. In my case, I prefer to install packages on an isolated Python environment using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

* Jupyter Notebooks and dependencies. `pip install jupyter`. More info on [this](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

You can find the complete list of packages I have on the virtualenv that I use for this repo on the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## What can you find in this repo?
Ipsum Loren and the rest of the paragraph.
